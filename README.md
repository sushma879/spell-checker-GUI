# spell-checker-GUI
 An application used to check the spelling errors in a word or a sentence using python modules<br>
 In this Python project, <br> we'll build a spell checker and corrector that can input a word or sentence  and produce a term that sounds close to it. <br>When a button is pressed, the term that is most similar to the input word will be displayed in the entry box.<br>
With a good spell check at hand you can quickly identify typos in your documents, remove grammar mistakes, replace a misspelled word with a proper equivalent, and do lots of other things to improve your writing and make it error-free. <br> <br>
